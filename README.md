Project bootstrapped with create-react-app: run by npm start.

Application styled only a little in Materialize(just wanted to check something oposite to Bootstrap).

Created with React and Redux app explores nice API about cocktails. You can search drinks by names, groups, letter
or glass and ingredient.

Happy Drinking!
